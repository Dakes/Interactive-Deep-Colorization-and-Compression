# ImageColorization
This originally was the codes for the paper "Interactive Deep Colorization and Its Application for Image Compression".  
It was modified modified with several improvements.  
TODO: 1. Implement improvements  
TODO: 2. List improvements  
TODO: 3. Profit?  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
